# WordleFromScratch


## Overview

This project is a custom implementation of the popular word-guessing game, **Wordle**, built entirely from scratch using Java. The game features an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) developed with Java Swing, providing players with a seamless and engaging experience.  

The objective is simple: guess the correct 5-letter word within six attempts. After each guess, the game provides feedback to help players refine their guesses, indicating correct letters in the correct positions and letters that are part of the word but misplaced.  

This project demonstrates strong object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, modular design, and the effective use of Java Swing for GUI development. Whether you're a fan of Wordle or a developer interested in learning about game development, this project is a great resource to explore!  

### Key Features
- Full game logic implemented in Java.
- Real-time feedback for player guesses.
